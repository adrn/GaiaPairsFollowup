\begin{abstract}
% Context
Widely-separated ($\gtrsim X$~pc), coeval stars are powerful tools for testing star-formation
model predictions, improving stellar atmosphere models, and inferring the
mass distribution of the Milky Way.
\smoh{The following sentence seems to be in the air while I get what you mean.}
They vastly outnumber the Galactic open clusters, but are still expected to
share a common origin and chemistry.
\smoh{How about sticking with the terminology ("comoving (star) pair") we want settled?}
The kinematic properties of comoving pairs including bound wide binaries
serve as potentiometers for the smooth tidal field and perturbation spectrum of
the Milky Way.
\smoh{If you are referring to Shaya \& Olling, how about adding 'using HIPPARCOS'?}
Thus far, a few hundred genuine comoving star pairs with separations as large
as $8~\pc$ have been discovered in the solar neighborhood.
% Aims
In previous work, we have identified $\sim 10,000$ candidate comoving star pairs
using only astrometric data from the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS)
catalog, a part of \gaia\ \DR{1}.
Without radial velocity measurements for the vast majority of the pairs, the
\smoh{I prefer "false-positive rate" to "contamination rate" because it conveys
the meaning more directly.}
contamination rate at large separations is significant ($\sim 50\%$).
% Methods
\smoh{I think some details of telescope/instrument or just R~2000 should be mentioned here.}
Here, we present results from our own low-resolution radial-velocity survey of a sample of the
candidate pairs to validate wide-separation comoving star pairs.
% Results
Of the 311 observed comoving pairs, we identify 128 genuine comoving pairs with
separations as large as $\approx 10~\pc$, our original search limit.
% Conclusions
We find that the number of comoving star pairs with very wide separations
appears flat in linear separation at separations $\gtrsim 1~\pc$, strongly
suggesting the existence of a population of recently unbound wide binaries or
stellar associations.
% Gaia DR2 -> how many do we expect? Can we say anything? Out to what distance and
% separation for a typical MS star can we determine they are bound assuming
% high-res spectra to get very precise RVs?

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

The majority of stars are thought to form in dynamically cold, chemically
homogeneous clusters, relative to the kinematic and chemical
dispersions observed amongst typical field stars in the Galactic disk.
Because star formation proceeds rapidly (e.g., \citealt{Bovy:2016}) and the
progenitor gas cloud disperses quickly (cite), it is typically assumed that
stars formed in the same birth cluster have the same initial chemistry
(e.g., cite + \citealt{Feng:2014}) and same ages.
These birth clusters are typically born un- or loosely-bound and therefore
quickly succumb to the tidal field of the Milky Way.
The initial kinematic associations between stars from the same cluster are then
erased as the constituent stars mix into the general population of disk stars.
However, the stars do preserve their initial associations in age, chemical
abundance patterns, and dynamical invariants (e.g., orbital actions).
It has therefore been long presumed that ``chemical tagging'' and chemodynamical
models of the Galactic disk will allow for inferences about the formation and
evolution of the Milky Way (e.g., \citealt{todo}).
That is, the chemical environment of a birth cluster is likely imprinted on its
stellar children and preserved so that their initial association may be inferred
with precisely measured abundance patterns (of $\gtrsim 10$ species).

The feasibility of chemical tagging depends on not only on the precision of
the abundance measurements but also on the intrinsic chemical
dispersions of stars formed from the same birth clusters,
and the ability to tell that the chemical abundances of
two stars from the same cluster are more similar than two randomly-paired Galactic disk stars.
Recent works suggest that, at least for red giant stars, the abundance
distributions of 20 elements in a handful of open clusters included in the
\acronym{APOGEE} survey (\citealt{Majewski:2016,Nidever:2015}) are consistent
with having intrinsic dispersions smaller than the abundance measurement
precisions ($\approx 0.03~\dex$; \citealt{Bovy:2016,Ness:2017}).
\smoh{I find the following sentence out of place. Doesn't it mean that
  the intrinsic dispersion is effectively zero rather than ``unconstrained''?}
In effect, for most elements, the intrinsic dispersions are unconstrained
because of measurement noise, so the true intrinsic dispersions are not known.
This demonstration of chemical uniformity in open clusters is promising for
chemical tagging.
However, it was also recently shown that $\approx 0.3\%$ of random pairings of
Galactic field red giant stars have abundance patterns that are
indistinguishable at the same level (``doppelgangers''), even with 20 chemical
species (\citealt{Ness:2017}).

Are these properties of open clusters universal, or limited to the few clusters
presently studied?
Do the chemical properties of open clusters depend on the star formation rate or
efficiency, which may evolve with time?
Ideal tests of the chemical homogeneity assumptions would use many more open
clusters with varied cluster masses and member stars that span a large range in
stellar masses and evolutionary stages.
Precise kinematic and color data from the \gaia\ mission
(\citealt{Gaia-Collaboration:2016,Gaia-Collaboration:2016a}) will help refine
existing membership catalogs and will lead to discoveries of many more open
clusters and young star associations (see, e.g., \citealt{Oh:2017}).
However, because they disrupt quickly (\smoh{a quantitative time scale?},
the present-day open cluster population
is biased towards younger or more massive clusters.

An alternate tracer of the chemical properties mentioned above are
widely-separated ($\gtrsim 0.01~\pc$), coeval pairs or multiplets of stars.
These tracers include both bound and unbound wide-separation stellar systems; we
refer to these systems collectively as ``comoving stars'' because, at large
separations with present-day and near-future velocity uncertainties, it is
typically not possible to determine whether these systems are truly bound.
Comoving stars are either wide binaries, disrupted wide binaries, or remnants of
dissolving or disrupted open clusters.
In any of these cases, it is likely that the stars formed from the same region
of a birth cloud, yet are separated enough that there has not been any
cross-pollution in the event of strong stellar winds or stellar evolution.

For chemical studies, open clusters have the advantage of having many stars per
cluster, but there are many fewer clusters than comoving stars.
Thanks to the \project{Hipparcos} mission (cite) and large radial-velocity
surveys (cite rave, etc.), several hundred such systems are already known
(\citealt{Shaya:2011}).
In addition, over ten-thousand \emph{candidate} comoving stars have been
discovered from astrometric data alone, using data from both the
\project{Hipparcos} mission (\citealt{ESA:1997}---\citealt{Shaya:2011}) and
\tgas\ catalog (\citealt{Gaia-Collaboration:2016a}---
\citealt{Oh:2017,Oelkers:2017,Andrews:2017}).
Radial velocity follow-up is necessary to confirm pairs using these astrometric
catalogs, though \gaia\ \DR{2} will provide radial velocities for the brightest
stars ($G < 12$).
High-resolution spectroscopy is still needed to measure detailed chemical
abundances of these pairs, which may present interesting surprises; one
large-separation ($\approx 0.6~\pc$) comoving pair of solar-type stars
discovered in previous work (\citealt{Oh:2017}) with serendipitously observed
high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra display large abundance
differences ($\approx 0.2~\dex$) that appear to have resulted from massive
accretion of planetary (rocky) material onto one of the two stars (Oh et al.,
submitted).

In this work, we present a catalog of genuine comoving star pairs discovered
through radial velocity follow-up of candidate comoving stars selected from
inferences using their astrometry alone (\citealt{Oh:2017}).
This work serves as a pilot study for data expected in upcoming data releases
from the \gaia\ mission.
We describe the data, observations, and spectroscopic reduction in
\sectionname~\ref{sec:data}.
If you are uninterested in these details, skip to \sectionname~\ref{sec:results}
and \sectionname~\ref{sec:discussion} where we present and discuss our main
results.

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Sample selection}\label{sec:sample}

In previous work, we have identified a sample of high-confidence, candidate
comoving star pairs (\citealt{Oh:2017}) using only astrometric information from
the \tgas\ catalog (\citealt{Michalik:2015,Gaia-Collaboration:2016a}).
These comoving pairs were selected using a cut on a marginalized likelihood
ratio computed for all nearly co-spatial pairs of stars.
Briefly, likelihood 1, $L_1$, considers a model in which the full-space
velocities of each star in the pair are identical and sampled from a disk-like,
Sun-relative velocity distribution, and likelihood 2, $L_2$, considers a model
in which the full-space velocities of each star were drawn independently from
the same velocity distribution used above. The computed likelihood ratio is
actually the ratio of fully marginalized likelihoods,
$\mathcal{L}_1/\mathcal{L}_2$, after marginalizing over true velocity and
distance for each star in a given pair.
After a parallax signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cut ($\pi/\sigma_\pi > 8$), we
compute the likelihood ratio for all stars within $10~\pc$ of each target star
from the \tgas\ catalog.
\smoh{To be complete, we should mention $\Delta v_\perp < 10$~km/s cut.
  Or I think it's also an option to cut on much of these details consistently.}
The likelihoods appropriately take into account the reported covariances and
uncertainties between the astrometric measurements in the \tgas\ catalog and
naturally handle geometric or projection effects in comparing spherical \smoh{?}
velocity components for star pairs separated by large angles on the sky.
After applying a conservative cut on the likelihood ratio motivated by computing
the same likelihood ratio for random pairings of stars ($\ln
\mathcal{L}_1/\mathcal{L}_2 > 6$, we find 13,058 comoving star pairs with
physical separations between $10^3~\au$ and $10~\pc$.
Of these pairs, there are 10,606 unique sources, implying that a significant
fraction of the identified pairs are members of larger groups.
$\approx$4,000 of the pairs are mutually exclusive, i.e. neither member is
paired with other stars.
For a full description of the selection method, see \citealt{Oh:2017}.

To select candidate pairs for follow-up spectroscopic observations, we only
consider mutually exclusive star pairs within $200~\pc$ in Heliocentric
distance; with the SNR cut used above and given the limitations of the \tgas\
catalog itself, \tgas\ is $\approx$90\% complete to $200~\pc$
(\citealt{Bovy:2017}).
From this source target list, we randomly observed targets with airmass $\sec z
< 1.5$.
\figurename~\ref{fig:sample-cmd} shows a color-magnitude diagram of all targets
observed in this observing run (markers) plotted over the density of all \tgas\
stars within $200~\pc$.
Candidate comoving pairs are connected by (colored) lines.

\subsection{Observations and data reduction}\label{sec:reduction}

Spectra were obtained using the \project{Modspec} spectrograph mounted on the
$2.4~{\rm m}$ Hiltner telescope at MDM
observatory\footnote{\url{http://mdm.kpno.noao.edu}} on Kitt Peak (Arizona).
\project{Modspec} was set up in long-slit mode with a 1\arcsec\ slit, a $600~{\rm
line}~{\rm mm}^{-1}$ grating, and a $2048\times2048~{\rm pixel}$ SITe CCD
detector (``Echelle'').
Only the central 300 pixel columns were read out from the CCD, and pixel rows
$>1600$ (at the blue end) were later trimmed because of the poor quantum
efficiency of the CCD at wavelengths $\lesssim 3600~{\rm \AA}$.
The resolution and wavelength range were $\approx2~{\rm \AA}~{\rm pixel}^{-1}$
from $\approx 3600$--$7200~{\rm \AA}$.
At this resolution, to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra, most exposures were
between $30$--$120~{\rm s}$ (15th and 85th percentiles).
To maximize the number of observed pairs, we chose not to take
comparison lamp spectra at each pointing as it adds an overhead of $\approx
90~{\rm s}$ per observation.
To determine rough nightly wavelength solutions, calibration spectra were obtained using
Hg-Ne and Ne comparison lamps at the beginning and end of each night.
Additionally, atmospheric emission lines were used to correct the wavelength solution on a
per-object basis.

We observed a total of 765 unique sources over 5 nights from (UT) 2017-03-11 to
2017-03-15, corresponding to 323 unique star pairs and $\approx 120$
calibration targets.
\smoh{How about ``The calibration targets serve two purposes. First, ...
  just so that it is more explicit, plain, and direct, and also ties in
  with how we chose the calibration targets?}
The calibration targets have previously measured radial velocities and chemical
abundances, which will be used for validation of our reduction pipeline and in
future work to measure metallicities and stellar parameters for each observed
source using \project{The Cannon} (\citealt{Ness:2015}).
The spectra were reduced and calibrated using a custom, publicly-available
pipeline written in \python, described below.
\smoh{How the calibration targets were chosen is missing here.}

\smoh{Throughout this paragraph, consider changing e.g.,
  ``16 pixel rows'' to ``16 pixels in wavelength direction''?
  Or explicitly mention somewhere (perhaps at the start of this section)
  that x (along rows) is spatial and y (along columns) is spectral direction?}
For each source or comparison lamp observation, the two-dimensional image is
bias corrected, flat-field corrected, and trimmed using standard routines
implemented in \package{ccdproc} (\citealt{Craig:2015}).
For comparison lamp observations, the central 100 pixel columns are extracted
and summed along the spatial axis, weighted by the inverse-variances of each
pixel.
Source spectral traces were always placed in this region during observations,
and the curvature of the wavelength solution over this region is negligible.
For source observations, 1D spectra are extracted using an empirical
estimate of the pixel-convolved line spread function (LSF): at each of 16 pixel
rows between indices 750 and 850 (i.e. around the effective center of the
dispersion axis), a model for the LSF is fit to the 1D trace.
The LSF is assumed to be a Voigt profile with parameters $A$, amplitude; $x_0$,
profile centroid; $\sigma_G$, Gaussian root-variance; $\gamma_L$, Lorentzian
half-width at half maximum, and the background is modeled using a linear
polynomial with parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, the slope and intercept
at the profile centroid, respectively.
The maximum-likelihood LSF + background model parameters are estimated from
each pixel row using \lbfgsb\ optimization (\citealt{Zhu:1994}), implemented in
the \package{scipy} package.
From the 16 fits, the median profile width parameters, $\sigma_G$ and
$\gamma_L$, are then taken to be the LSF width parameters.
At each of 1600 rows in each source spectrum image, the LSF amplitude and
centroid, and background slope and intercept at line centroid, are then fit
using the same procedure as above but with the width parameters fixed.
The LSF amplitudes are stored as the source fluxes, and the background model
intercepts are stored as the background (sky) fluxes.
Occasionally, nearby sources fall in the slit; these are masked by hand in the
2D images and do not bias the LSF extraction fits.

We start the wavelength calibration by interactively identifying the 12
strongest, least blended emission lines in one of the extracted 1D comparison
lamp spectra by comparing to standard HgNe line lists.\footnote{\url{http:
//physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html}}
Once a rough mapping from pixel to wavelength is determined, we then fit for the
individual line centroids in each comparison lamp spectrum by extracting small,
8 pixel-wide segments of the comparison lamp spectrum around each identified
emission line and fitting a model for the line profile and background to each
individually.
We use a pixel-convolved Gaussian profile for each emission line with
parameters: amplitude, $A$; centroid, $x_0$; and root-variance, $\sigma_G$.
We find that nearby blended or low-amplitude lines (i.e. part of the
``background'') sometimes bias the line centroid determination when using a
simple background model.
We therefore model the background flux around each comparison lamp emission
line using a constant offset + Gaussian process (GP).
For the GP model, we use a Mat\'ern 3/2 kernel function
(\citealt{Matern:1986,Rasmussen:2005}) parametrized by amplitude parameter
$\sigma_{3/2}$ and correlation scale $\rho_{3/2}$.
We use \package{celerite} (\citealt{Foreman-Mackey:2017}) to evaluate the full
likelihood for this model, and maximize the (log-)likelihood again using
\lbfgsb\ optimization.
We optimize over the logarithm of any scale parameters (i.e. $A$, $\sigma_G$,
$\sigma_{3/2}$, and $\rho_{3/2}$).
Once we determine the pixel centroids for all identified emission lines for a
given night's comparison lamp spectrum, we then fit an interpolating function
to the pixel-centroid, wavelength values for each emission line.

Typically, high-order standard polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials are used to
fit for the wavelength dispersion function.
We found that using such functions can lead to vastly incorrect wavelength
values near either end of the pixel grid where the polynomial function is
un- or weakly-constrained.
We instead use a combined linear polynomial + GP to model the wavelength
dispersion.
We again use a Mat\'ern 3/2 kernel, use \lbfgsb\ optimization, and convert any
scale parameter to log-space before maximizing the log-likelihood.
\figurename~\ref{fig:wavelength-GP} shows an example of the residuals from one
such fit; black points show the (pixel-centroid, wavelength) pairs with the
best-fit model subtracted.
The envelope around zero (shaded region, orange) shows the variance of the GP
model projected into the data space; when the GP variance is large, the
pixel-to-wavelength mapping is uncertain.
We therefore only use the pixel range from 250--1210, corresponding to a
wavelength range of $\approx 5500$--$7400~{\rm \AA}$; gray shaded region shows
the excluded pixel/wavelength ranges.

This wavelength calibration procedure produces a nightly model for the
nonlinear dispersion of wavelength as a function of pixel value for each
extracted 1D spectrum.
However, because of flexure in the spectrograph, each observation will have an
additional offset of, typically, $\approx 0.5$--$2~{\rm \AA}$, corresponding to
a significant velocity offset at \Ha\ of $\approx 25$--$100~\kms$ (discussed
below).
\figurename~\ref{fig:sample-spectra} shows a random sample of 10
wavelength-calibrated source spectra of comoving star pair members normalized
to 1 at $\lambda = 5500~{\rm \AA}$ and \smoh{shifted by index (confusing)} for visualization.
As suggested by the features in these 10 spectra, there is a mix of
metallicities and spectral types amongst the observed targets.
Note that the spectra are not flux-calibrated, as we only care about measuring
radial velocities from this sample.

\end{figure}

As mentioned, comparison lamp spectra were not obtained at each telescope
pointing.
The absolute wavelength solution at each pointing can therefore be shifted
(in pixels) relative to the nightly comparison lamp spectrum because of flexure
in the instrument.
We have found that this offset depends primarily on the hour angle of the
observation, likely because of the physical orientation of the spectrograph and
CCD as mounted on the telescope.
To correct each source spectrum for this offset, we measure the centroids of
the two prominent [OI] sky emission lines near $5577~{\rm \AA}$ and $6300~{\rm
\AA}$ in the corresponding background spectrum derived from the spectral
extraction (described above).
We use a pixel-convolved Voigt profile as the emission line model (same
parameters as above) and a Gaussian process with a Mat\'ern 3/2 kernel function
for the background spectrum (same parameters as above).
We again use \lbfgsb\ optimization and convert any scale parameter to log-space
before maximizing the log-likelihood of this model to derive the line centroid
in wavelength units.
We compute wavelength offsets from true (air) values of the line centroids,
$5577.3387~{\rm \AA}$ and $6300.304~{\rm \AA}$ respectively,\footnote{\url{http:
//physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html}} then convert these
wavelength offsets to pixel offsets.
We take the mean of the pixel offsets and apply the derived shift to the source
spectrum before re-computing the wavelength grid using the nightly wavelength
solution.
When one or both of the two sky lines is not present or the centroid fit fails,
the spectrum is flagged as having a suspect wavelength calibration.
In practice, most such sources are calibration targets, which are more likely to
have very short exposure times and thus weak night-sky lines.

To derive radial velocities for each source, we then measure the (wavelength)
line centroid of \Ha\ in each corrected spectrum.
We model the absorption line using a pixel-convolved Voigt profile and use a
linear model + a Gaussian process for the background model.
We now use \lbfgsb\ optimization and the resulting maximum-likelihood parameters
to initialize a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the posterior
probability distribution (PDF) over the 8 parameters: $\ln |A|$, $x_0$,
$\ln\sigma_G$, $\ln\gamma_L$, $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\ln\sigma_{3/2}$, and
$\ln\rho_{3/2}$ where the linear background model is defined as $f(\lambda) =
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2\,\lambda$.
The linear amplitude, $A$, is assumed to be negative (i.e. \Ha\ is assumed to be
an absorption feature) and is computed from the corresponding parameter as $A =
-\exp(\ln |A|)$.
We use uniform priors on all parameters except $\ln\rho_{3/2}$, for which we use
a Gaussian; prior parameters are specified in \tablename~\ref{tbl:prior-bounds}.
We use \package{emcee} (\citealt{Foreman-Mackey:2013}) with 64 walkers to
generate samples from the posterior PDF.
We initially run the sampler for 128 steps from the maximum likelihood parameter
values, then resample walker positions in a small ball around the median final
walker positions and run again for 512 steps; together, these two steps
constitute our burn-in phase.
From the final walker positions after burn-in, we run again for 1024 steps and
store these as our posterior samples.
\figurename~\ref{fig:Halpha-mcmc-corner} shows a \package{corner} plot
(\citealt{Foreman-Mackey:2016}) of all projections of these posterior PDF
samples for a randomly-chosen source (HD 63408, in this case).
The marginal posterior distribution over $x_0$ can be converted to a
distribution over radial velocity; in this case, the estimated (Gaussian
standard deviation) precision is $\approx 2.5~\kms$.
\figurename~\ref{fig:Halpha-mcmc-fit} shows the segment of the source spectrum
around \Ha\ used in the line modeling (black line) with uncertainties (gray
bars).
Top panel shows the linear polynomial + absorption line model computed for the
median sample (dark green line); shaded region shows the 15th to 85th
percentiles computed from all posterior samples.
Bottom panel shows the residuals of the data from the median linear polynomial +
absorption line model (black line) along with the Gaussian process computed from
the median parameters (orange curve) used to model other correlated structure in
the vicinity of \Ha (which can be interpreted as correlated noise).
These figures are produced for all source spectrum fits and visually inspected
to ensure that the MCMC sampling appears to have converged for all cases.

For each source spectrum, with the resulting posterior samples, we compute the
median and median absolute deviation (MAD) of the marginal distribution over
line centroid, $x_0$.
We use the MAD to estimate the standard deviation ($\sigma \approx 1.5\times{\rm
MAD}$, assuming the samples are Gaussian distributed) of the samples and find
that the typical velocity \emph{precision} from measuring the centroid of \Ha\
is between $5$--$10~\kms$.

\subsection{Validation of absolute radial velocities}\label{sec:rv-validation}

Several of our targets and all of our calibration targets have previously
measured radial velocities (RVs).
We can therefore estimate the absolute velocity uncertainties by comparing our
derived radial velocities with high-quality prior measurements.
Following previous work (\citealt{Shaya:2011}), we search for previous RV
measurements (in decreasing order of priority) with:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Geneva-Copenhagen Survey of the Solar Neighborhood
  (\citealt{Nordstrom:2004}).
  \item The Catalogue of Radial Velocities of Galactic Stars with Astrometric
  Data, the Second Version (\citealt{Kharchenko:2007}).
  \item The General Catalogue of Mean Radial Velocities
  (\citealt{Barbier-Brossat:2000}).
  \item The SIMBAD database (\citealt{Wenger:2000}). We use \package{astroquery}
  (\citealt{Ginsburg:2016}) to retrieve records from the database, which do not
  contain uncertainties but do contain a quality flag. We only retain RVs that
  have a quality flag set to `A' and adopt a $5~\kms$ uncertainty for all such
  values.
\end{enumerate}
% See: paper/figures/Compare with previous observations.ipynb
We find that 155 of the observed stars (mainly calibration targets) have
reliable prior measurements from the literature search described above.
\figurename~\ref{fig:compare-previous} shows the distribution of velocity
differences between our measurements and literature values.
From this distribution (right panel), we compute the median absolute deviation
(MAD) and estimate the standard deviation to be $\approx 20~\kms$, which we
adopt as our global systematic error for all absolute radial velocities.
We note, however, that for computing \emph{relative} velocities for pairs of
nearby stars, it is the RV precision (typically $\approx 5$--$10~\kms$) that
matters.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

\subsection{Comoving pair catalog}\label{sec:catalog}

Of the 323 observed star pairs, 12 have at least one member with an unreliable
(flagged) radial velocity measurement from the pipeline above.
For the remaining 311 pairs, we use the measured radial velocities to re-compute
the marginal likelihood ratio for the two hypotheses considered in previous work
(see Appendix~B, \citealt{Oh:2017}).
We compute two fully marginalized likelihoods (FMLs) for the data: (1) assuming
that the two stars are comoving with identical 3D velocity vectors (within some
allowed small dispersion), and (2) assuming that the two stars have independent
3D velocity vectors drawn from a prior velocity distribution.
As with previous work, we set the small dispersion to the orbital velocity of a
binary with the separation of the pair, and use a mixture of three Gaussian
velocity components for the prior, meant to represent the thin disk, thick disk,
and halo velocity distributions relative to the sun.

To compute the new likelihood ratio, we modify the expressions from
\citet{Oh:2017} to include the radial velocity measurements.
In the same notation, this requires the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The projection matrix, $\mat{M}$, now has to include the radial unit
    vector
    \begin{equation}
      \mat{M} =
        \left(
          \begin{array}{c c c}
            -\sin\alpha & \cos\alpha & 0 \\
            -\sin\delta \, \cos\alpha & -\sin\delta \, \sin\alpha & \cos\delta\\
            \cos\delta \, \cos\alpha & \cos\delta \, \sin\alpha & \sin\delta
          \end{array}
        \right)
    \end{equation}
    where $(\alpha, \delta)$ are the ICRS coordinates (right ascension and
    declination) of a given star.
  \item The data-space velocity vector, $\vec{y}$, for one star now becomes
    \begin{equation}
      \vec{y} =
        \transpose{\left(
          \begin{array}{c c c}
            r_i\,\mu_{\alpha}^* &
            r_i\,\mu_{\delta} &
            v_{r}
          \end{array}
        \right)}
    \end{equation}
    where $\mu_\alpha^*$ is the proper motion in right ascension (including the
    $\cos{\delta}$ term), $\mu_\delta$ is the proper motion in declination, and
    $v_r$ is the radial velocity.
  \item The covariance matrix becomes the block-diagonal matrix
    \begin{equation}
      \mat{\Sigma} = \left(
        \begin{array}{c c}
          r^2 \, \mat{C} & 0 \\
          0 & \sigma_{v_r}^2
        \end{array}
      \right)
    \end{equation}
    where $r$ is the distance, $\mat{C}$ is the proper motion covariance matrix
    (from the \tgas\ catalog), and $\sigma_{v_r}$ is the radial velocity
    uncertainty.
\end{itemize}
To compute the FML for hypothesis 1 for a pair of stars $(i,j)$, the data-space
vector must become the 6-vector
\begin{equation}
  \vec{y} = \transpose{\left(
    \begin{array}{c c}
      \vec{y}_i &
      \vec{y}_j
    \end{array}
    \right)}
\end{equation}
and the covariance matrix becomes the block-diagonal matrix
\begin{equation}
  \mat{\Sigma} = \left(
    \begin{array}{c c}
      \mat{\Sigma}_i & 0 \\
      0 & \mat{\Sigma}_j
    \end{array}
  \right) \quad .
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

If the new likelihood ratio is larger than that computed from astrometry alone,
the added radial velocity information likely supports the belief that the two
stars are truly comoving in 3-space.
Conversely, if the new likelihood ratio is smaller, the radial velocity data
indicate that the pair is likely a false-positive and are not truly comoving.
In practice, we compute the logarithm of the likelihood ratios,
$\mathcal{R} = \ln \mathcal{L}_1/\mathcal{L}_2$; we refer to the
proper-motion-only log-FML-ratio for a given pair of stars as
\llrold\, and the log-FML-ratio including the radial velocity data as
\llrnew.
We consider a pair as being genuinely comoving if $\llrnew > \llrold$; 128 of
the 311 comoving pairs satisfy this constraint.
\figurename~\ref{fig:llr} shows the magnitude of the 3D velocity difference
plotted against the change in log-likelihood-ratio for the two stars in all
observed pairs.
In detail, for visualization, we sample from the error distributions over proper
motion, parallax, and radial velocity for each star individually and compute the
magnitude of the 3D velocity differences, $|\bs{v}_1-\bs{v}_2|$, for $2^{16}$
samples.
We plot the median of the resulting distribution over velocity-difference as
dark markers (circles).
The error bars show the 15th and 85th percentiles of the distributions for a few
randomly chosen pairs.
Note that pairs with large 3D velocity differences have large (negative) changes
to their log-likelihood-ratio values.

\subsection{Properties of genuine comoving pairs}\label{sec:genuine}

\figurename~\ref{fig:dx-dv} shows the magnitude of the 3D velocity difference
plotted against the 3D positional separation of the two stars in all observed
pairs.
We again plot the median of the velocity difference distribution, and here use
the Lutz-Kelker-corrected distance estimate (\citealt{Lutz:1973}) computed from
the stars' \tgas\ parallax measurements to compute the 3D positions of the two
stars.
Small, gray markers are pairs for which $\llrnew < \llrold$, i.e. where the
radial velocity measurements weaken or change our belief that a given pair is
comoving.
Larger, black markers are genuine comoving pairs ($\llrnew > \llrold$); note
that many large-separation pairs have been ruled-out as comoving, but
most small-separation pairs maintain their status as comoving.
This is also apparent in \figurename~\ref{fig:separation}, which shows
histograms of the spatial separation and sky separation for all pairs;
background, gray histogram shows all observed pairs, and foreground, black
histogram shows all pairs for which $\llrnew > \llrold$.

\todo{Discuss contamination rate vs. separation for ratio cut of 6?}
At separations $\gtrsim 1~\pc$, $\approx 40\%$ of the comoving pairs are
genuinely comoving; interestingly, the separation distribution of the genuine
pairs appears to be at least uniform or possibly growing in number as the
separation increases.
This strongly suggests the existence of a population of unbound wide binaries or
dissolved open clusters, which maintain approximate spatial coherence for long
times because of the small relative velocities at the time of disruption of the
constituent stars (e.g., \citealt{Jiang:2010}).
The kinematic properties of these unbound binaries and associations contain
information about the tidal field and fluctuations in the mass distribution of
the Milky Way.
With \gaia\ \DR{2}, we will be able to study the statistical properties of these
widely-separated but comoving stars at even larger separations ($>10~\pc$).

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

Once chemical homogeneity understood amongst stars of same spectral type, can be used to calibrate stellar models across the HR diagram: should have same age, chemistry, etc. Also tests of chemical enrichment due to planetary systems

Comoving stars are also sensitive potentiometers of the Galactic mass
distribution.
- Long-term goal is to study the separation distribution of wide-binaries as a
  function of age and Galactic orbit distribution (disk vs. halo)
    - Is there a separation truncation?
    - Can that be described just from Galactic tides, or need perturbers?

% Caution that prior results are for red giants, MS stars may have planetary
% imprints that get erased as dredge-up and convective layer erases...

\todo{Cross-match with exoplanets catalog http://exoplanets.org/csv-files/exoplanets.csv}

\todo{Do I want to do isochrone fitting for all of them?}

Abundances!

- Stellar rotation of evolved-main sequence
- Full catalog should contain Shaya and Olling, cross-match to RV surveys
