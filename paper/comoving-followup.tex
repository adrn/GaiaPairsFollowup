\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Outline:
- Stars form in clusters, chemically homogeneous at some level
- Clusters generally disrupt slowly through a process that preserves initial
  clustering in conserved quantities but destroys phase coherence
- Most significant process is probably tidal heating
- Dissolved clusters are therefore useful dynamical tracers of mass distribution
- In Galactic halo, globular clusters
- In disk, hope is to use chemical signatures to connect stars, then can use
  dynamics to reconstruct birth clusters, infer mass distribution / evolution
- Clusters have advantage of many stars per cluster, but fewer clusters
- Wide binary stars are little potentiometers themselves - only N=2, but are far
  more numerous as a population
- Long-term goal is to study the separation distribution of wide-binaries as a
  function of age and Galactic orbit distribution (disk vs. halo)
    - Is there a separation truncation?
    - Can that be described just from Galactic tides, or need perturbers?
- Also useful for stellar models: should have same age, chemistry, but need to
  test this
    - Chemical homogeneity tested with few open clusters - wide binaries another
      test
    - Need sample of confirmed widely-separated binaries, follow-up to get
      detailed abundances
    - Need way to verify that widely separated stars are physically associated,
      via kinematics
- Some bullshit about Gaia, TGAS, etc., released as a part of \gaia\ \DR{1}\

\cite{Gaia-Collaboration:2016,Gaia-Collaboration:2016a}

Most stars form in clusters with small dispersions in position, velocity, and
(likely) small initial spreads in chemical abundances.
Once a given cluster is visibly dispersing or fully dispersed, the former member
stars retain chemical and kinematic signatures of their birth cluster

Widely-separated comoving stars are expected to form from the dissolution of
birth star clusters


\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Sample selection}\label{sec:sample}

In previous work, we have identified a sample of high-confidence, candidate
comoving star pairs (\citealt{Oh:2017}) using only astrometric information from
the \tgas\ catalog (\citealt{tgas}).
These comoving pairs were selected using a cut on a marginalized likelihood
ratio computed for all nearly co-spatial pairs of stars.
For a full description of the selection method, see \citealt{Oh:2017}.
Briefly, likelihood 1, $L_1$, considers a model in which the full-space
velocities of each star in the pair are identical and sampled from a disk-like,
Sun-relative velocity distribution, and likelihood 2, $L_2$, considers a model
in which the full-space velocities of each star were drawn independently from
the same velocity distribution used above; the likelihood ratio is computed as
$L_1/L_2$.
After a parallax signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cut ($\pi/\sigma_\pi > 8$), we
compute the likelihood ratio for all stars within $10~\pc$ of each target star
from the \tgas\ catalog.
The likelihoods appropriately take into account the reported covariances and
uncertainties between the astrometric measurements in the \tgas\ catalog and
naturally handle geometric or projection effects in comparing spherical
velocity components for star pairs separated by large angles on the sky.
After applying a conservative cut on the likelihood ratio motivated by
computing the same likelihood ratio for random pairings of stars, we find
13,058 comoving star pairs with physical separations between $10^3~\au$ and
$10~\pc$.
Of these pairs, there are 10,606 unique sources, implying that a significant
fraction of the identified pairs are members of larger groups.
$\approx$4,000 of the pairs are mutually exclusive, i.e. neither member is
paired with other stars.

To select candidate pairs for follow-up spectroscopic observations, we only
consider mutually exclusive star pairs within $200~\pc$ in Heliocentric
distance; with the SNR cut used above and given the limitations of the \tgas\
catalog itself, \tgas\ is $\approx$90\% complete to $200~\pc$
(\citealt{Bovy:2017}).
From this source target list, we randomly observed targets with airmass $\sec z
< 1.5$.

\subsection{Observations and data reduction}\label{sec:reduction}

Spectra were obtained using the \project{Modspec} spectrograph mounted on the
$2.4~{\rm m}$ Hiltner telescope at MDM
observatory\footnote{\url{http://mdm.kpno.noao.edu}} on Kitt Peak (Arizona).
\project{Modspec} was set up in long-slit mode with a 1'' slit, a $600~{\rm
line}~{\rm mm}^{-1}$ grating, and a $2048\times2048~{\rm pixel}$ SITe CCD
detector (``Echelle'').
Only the central 300 pixel columns were read out from the CCD, and pixel rows
$>1600$ (at the blue end) were later trimmed because of the poor quantum
efficiency of the CCD at wavelengths $\lesssim 3600~{\rm \AA}$.
The resolution and wavelength range were $\approx2~{\rm \AA}~{\rm pixel}^{-1}$
from $\approx 3600$--$7200~{\rm \AA}$.
At this resolution, to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra, most exposures were
between $30$--$120~{\rm s}$ (15th and 85th percentiles).
To maximize the number of observed pairs, we therefore chose to not take
comparison lamp spectra at each pointing, which adds an overhead of $\approx
90~{\rm s}$ per observation.
To determine rough nightly wavelength solutions, spectra were obtained using
Hg-Ne and Ne comparison lamps at the beginning and end of each night, and
atmospheric emission lines were used to correct the wavelength solution on a
per-object basis.

We observed a total of 765 unique sources over 5 nights from (UT) 2017-03-11 to
2017-03-15, corresponding to 321 unique star pairs and $\approx 120$
calibration targets.
The calibration targets have previously measured radial velocities and chemical
abundances, which will be used for validation of our reduction pipeline and in
future work to measure metallicities and stellar parameters for each observed
source using \project{The Cannon} (\citealt{Ness:TODO}).
The spectra were reduced and calibrated using a custom, publicly-available
pipeline written in \python,\footnote{Released along with the code used to
generate the figures in this document at
\url{https://github.com/adrn/GaiaPairsFollowup}.} described below.

For each source or comparison lamp observation, the two-dimensional image is
bias corrected, flat-field corrected, and trimmed using standard routines
implemented in \package{ccdproc} (\citealt{Craig:2015}).
For comparison lamp observations, the central 100 pixel columns are extracted
and summed along the spatial axis, weighted by the inverse-variances of each
pixel.
Source spectral traces were always placed in this region during observations,
and the curvature of the wavelength solution over this region is negligible.
For source observations, the 2D spectra are extracted to 1D using an
empirically-estimated line spread function (LSF): at each of 16 pixel rows
between indices 750 and 850 (i.e. around the effective center of the dispersion
axis), a model for the LSF is fit to the 1D trace.
The LSF is assumed to be a Voigt profile with parameters $A$, amplitude; $x_0$,
profile centroid; $\sigma_G$, Gaussian root-variance; $\gamma_L$, Lorentzian
half-width at half maximum, and the background is modeled using a linear
polynomial with parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$, the slope and intercept
at the profile centroid, respectively.
The maximum-likelihood LSF + background model parameters are estimated from
each pixel row using \lbfgsb\ optimization (\citealt{Zhu:1994}), implemented in
the \package{scipy} package.
From the 16 fits, the median profile width parameters, $\sigma_G$ and
$\gamma_L$, are then taken to be the LSF width parameters.
At each of 1600 rows in each source image, the LSF amplitude and centroid, and
background slope and intercept at line centroid are then fit using the same
procedure as above but with the width parameters fixed.
The LSF amplitudes are stored as the source fluxes, and the background model
intercepts are stored as the background (sky) fluxes.
Occasionally, nearby sources fall in the slit; these are masked by hand in the
2D images and do not bias the LSF extraction fits.

We start the wavelength calibration by interactively identifying the 12
strongest, least blended emission lines in one of the extracted 1D comparison
lamp spectra by comparing to \todo{NIST??}.
Once a rough mapping from pixel to wavelength is determined, we then fit for
the individual line centroids in each comparison lamp spectrum by extracting
small, 8 pixel-wide segments of spectrum around each identified emission line
and fitting a model for the line profile and background to each individually.
We use a Gaussian profile for each emission line with parameters: amplitude,
$A$; centroid, $x_0$; and root-variance, $\sigma_G$.
We find that nearby blended or low-amplitude lines (i.e. part of the
``background'') sometimes bias the line centroid determination when using a
simple background model.
We therefore model the background flux around each comparison lamp emission
line using a constant offset + Gaussian process (GP).
For the GP model, we use a Mat\'ern 3/2 kernel function
(\citealt{Matern:1986,Rasmussen:2005}) parametrized by amplitude parameter
$\sigma_{3/2}$ and correlation scale $\rho_{3/2}$.
We use \package{celerite} (\citealt{Foreman-Mackey:2017}) to evaluate the full
likelihood for this model, and maximize the (log-)likelihood again using
\lbfgsb\ optimization.
We optimize over the logarithm of any scale parameters (i.e. $A$, $\sigma_G$,
$\sigma_{3/2}$, and $\rho_{3/2}$).
Once we determine the pixel centroids for all identified emission lines for a
given night's comparison lamp spectrum, we then fit an interpolating function
to the pixel-centroid, wavelength values for each emission line.

Typically, high-order standard polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials are used to
fit for the wavelength dispersion function.
We found that using such functions can lead to vastly incorrect wavelength
values near either end of the pixel grid where the polynomial function is
un- or weakly-constrained.
We instead use a combined linear polynomial + GP to model the wavelength
dispersion.
We again use a Mat\'ern 3/2 kernel, use \lbfgsb\ optimization, and convert any
scale parameter to log-space before maximizing the log-likelihood.
\figurename~\ref{fig:wavelength-GP} shows an example of the residuals from one
such fit; black points show the (pixel-centroid, wavelength) pairs with the
best-fit model subtracted.
The envelope around zero (shaded region, orange) shows the \todo{1$\sigma$ blah
blah GP...}
When the GP variance is large, the pixel-to-wavelength mapping is uncertain.
We therefore only use the pixel range from 250--1210, corresponding to a
wavelength range of $\approx 5500$--$7400~{\rm \AA}$; grey shaded region shows
the excluded pixel/wavelength ranges.

This wavelength calibration procedure produces a nightly model for the
nonlinear dispersion of wavelength as a function of pixel value for each
extracted 1D spectrum.
However, because of flexure in the spectrograph, each observation will have an
additional offset of, typically, $\approx 0.5$--$2~{\rm \AA}$, corresponding to
a significant velocity offset at ${\rm H}\alpha$ of $\approx 20$--$100~\kms$.
\figurename~\ref{fig:sample-spectra} shows a random sample of 10 source spectra
of comoving star pair members normalized to 1 at $\lambda = 5500~{\rm \AA}$ and
shifted by index for visualization.
From the appearances of these 10 spectra, it seems there is a mix of
metallicities and spectral types amongst the observed targets.
Note that the spectra are not flux-calibrated, as we only care about measuring
radial velocities from this sample.
