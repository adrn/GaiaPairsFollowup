Referee Report

This manuscript presents a follow-up spectroscopy study of
co-moving pairs of stars identified in the TGAS survey by Oh et. al
(2017). Radial velocity measurements are obtained for both components
in 311 pairs, with the goal to try and confirm whether the pairs are
truly co-moving objects or simple change alignments. Metallicity
information is also obtained for a smaller number of sources. The
manuscript claims the confirmation of 127 pairs as genuine co-moving
objects, including some pairs with separations as large as 10pc.

Unfortunately, the present study does not satisfactorily demonstrate
that pairs with large separations (d>1pc) are co-moving. In fact, a
careful examination of the data suggests quite the opposite - see
below for a list of counterarguments (-> major concerns). As a result,
the paper should not be accepted in its current form.

It is possible that the referee might have been confused by the
presentation, in which case a revised manuscript with more rigorous
demonstration might be acceptable. However, the referee urges the
authors to carefully reconsider their evidence in light of the
comments below.

In any case, the radial velocity data collected for this program is
interesting and useful, and would be worth publishing. For this
reason, the authors are urged to submit a revised version of the
manuscript.



Major concerns:
===============

While the analysis convincingly shows that the short separation pairs
(d<2pc) are indeed co-moving systems (perhaps even wide binaries), the
claim that some of the pairs with large separations (2pc<d<10pc) are
also co-moving does not appear to be supported by the follow-up data.

A fundamental property of co-moving pairs is that for the pairs to
remain coherent (i.e. close to each other) over tens to hundreds of
millions of years requires that their velocity differences be very
small. As an example, a 1km/s velocity difference translates into a
motion of 1 parsec per million year. Therefore if the pairs are still
coherent within 10pc of each other after 100Myr or more, then it means
that the velocity difference between the components must be less than
0.1 km/s. Therefore, high-resolution observations would normally be
required to demonstrate the co-moving status of two stars.

Additionally, the global velocity scatter in the local field
population for moderately young (<2Gyr) stars is about 30 km/s. This
however is for the *global* distribution. In the direction of the
north and south Galactic poles, the velocity scatter is significantly
smaller, due to sigma_W~12 km/s (Nordtrsom et al. 2004). In the
direction of the apex and antapex of the Sun's orbital motion, the
scatter is just sigma_V~15 km/s. As a result, one would expect the
typical difference in radial velocity between any two randomly
selected stars young stars in the local field population to be in the
the 10km/s-30km/s range, depending on the direction on the sky.

The evidence shown in Figure 4 and Figure 8 shows two distinct
populations:

(1) Co-moving pairs with separations <3pc. These clearly have
total velocity differences |v1-v2| that are smaller than the expected
10-30km/s random scatter, and their differences in radial velocities
are also convincingly small. In addition, Figure 8 shows that these
pairs have similar abundances.

(2) Co-moving pairs with separations >3pc. These have a much large
scatter in total velocity differences |v1-v2|. It is clear that the
pairs with |v1-v2|>20km/s cannot be co-moving. Figure 8 also shows
that a large fraction of those large separation systems also have a
significant scatter in both their radial velocity differences AND in
their metallicity differences.

Hence, there is no doubt that at least a significant fraction of the
large-separation, co-moving pairs originally selected in Oh
et. al. (2017) are no actually co-moving. That there is significant
contamination means that one must be careful about pairs that are
found to have similar radial velocities. The medium-resolution spectra
that were obtained in the follow-up study have a precision of only
5-10km/s, which is large considering that the field population itself
is expected to have a scatter of 10-30 km/s. One would, for example,
expect that a large fraction of the pairs with RV differences <10km/s
to be chance alignments of unrelated objects. Even pairs with measured
RV differences 1-2 km/s could still be chance alignments of unrelated
stars, since the tru requirement for two star to actually be co-moving
is that they must have RV differences <0.1km/s (see above).

Therefore, a look at the distribution in Figure 4 would suggest that
at least *some* of the pairs with |v1-v2|<10km/s should be chance
alignments. However, the plot shows that essentially *all* pairs
with |v1-v2|<10km/s are marked as "confirmed" (bold point). This is
not what one would expect. The fact that the number of "confirmed"
pairs increases with physical separation further corroborates the idea
that at least some of them are chance alignments; this is probably a
contentious point since one can argue that the increase represents a
true feature of the separation distribution

Note that this is not an issue for the short-separation pairs, since
they don't show any evidence of contamination - none of the pairs with
short separations have |v1-v2|>25km/s. Therefore we need not worry
about these. However, since we know that there actually *is*
substantial contamination in the large separation subset means that we
must be extremely cautious.

Now, the criterion used to claim that the large-separation pairs are
real is the likelihood ratio R_RV-R_mu. The argument is that if the
addition of the radial velocity information has increased the
likelihood of the pairing, then the pair must be real. However, if the
radial velocity difference happens to be small only by chance, then of
course we will get R_RV>R_mu, but that does not necessarily mean that
the pair is genuine. There are so many pairs for which the RV
decreases the probability of the pairing, 184/311 pairs actually, that
this signals that chance alignments in RV space will probably lead to
some pairs having RV<10km/s, which will increase their R_RV compared
to the original R_mu. In short, because you find an increase in
probability when you add new data doesn't mean that the probability is
in fact 100%. The increase could be due to chance.

In fact, one can see a point in Figure 4 representing a star with
R_RV>R_mu, but this star has |v1-v2|>50km/s! This is a hint that the
R_RV>R_mu criterion is not sufficient to "confirm" the pair as genuine.

In addition, the mismatch in the apparent ages of HD 95088 and HD
92278 finds a very simple explanation if the two stars are in fact
simple chance alignments of unrelated objects. This may not be the
only pair with mismatched ages, although it is the most obvious one.

A more convincing diagram would be one that shows the distribution of
RV differences as a function of physical separation. From the "wings"
of the distribution |Delta_RV|>15km/s, one could probably model the
distribution to get an idea of the density in "core"
|Delta_RV|<15km/s. There are other simple statistical tests that could
be made but I will leave that to the authors to figure out.

To summarize: the current version of the manuscript does not make a
convincing case that the large-separation pairs are true co-moving
pairs, rather than simple chance alignments of unrelated stars.


Minor concerns:
===============

(1) The comparison with LAMOST metallicity and Delta-RV seems important
enough for the case that it should probably be detailed in its own
subsection, rather than being placed in the discussion.

(2) The description of the data reduction in the appendices is perhaps
too detailed and too general, especially the 1D spectrum extraction
and wavelength calibration. If this is standard procedure for
MDM-MODSPEC reduction, then these details make the paper
unnecessarily long. Publishing these details might however be useful
if this is a novel reduction procedure - but this does not seem to be
the case. The RV measurements on the other hand might be worth
detailing if the procedure is truly novel, or if it is critical in
demonstrating the level of RV precision needed for the study.



Other suggested changes:
========================

Section 1, paragraph 5:
-----------------------
"is found to be alpha~1.5-2 out to..."

Since the alpha power law is determined for the distribution of
separations, the sentence should be reversed here:

"is found to be alpha~1.5-2 out to projected separations ~0.65pc
(~0.25degrees of angular separation on the sky at a distance of
150pc),"



Section 1, paragraph 7:
-----------------------
"that falls of until" -> "that falls off until"


Section 2.1, paragraph 2:
-------------------------
"...likelihood ratio for all stars within 10pc and with a
difference..."

Perhaps you mean:

"...likelihood ratio for a star to have another star within 10 pc of
itself, and with a difference..."


Section 2.1, paragraph 3:
-------------------------
"...exclusive star pairs within 200 pc in Heliocentric distance."
->
"...exclusive stars pairs with heliocentric distances d<200pc.


"...used above and given the limitations of the TGAS catalog
itself..."
->
"...used above, and within the limits of the TGAS catalog itself
(e.g. magnitude range), TGAS is..."


"...with airmass sec z < 1.5..."
->
[The airmass is an incidental parameter of the observations, not an
intrinsic property of the targets. This statement should therefore be
moved to section 2.2.]


"...all TGAS stars within 200 pc."
->
[Please cite the actual number of TGAS stars within 200pc.]
