Our selection of the candidates does not involve selecting common proper motion
pairs of stars: as is described in this and in previous work, we ask whether two
stars are consistent with having the same 3D Cartesian velocity given parallax
and proper motion components. This is subtly different, however we do
acknowledge that this will skew the velocity-difference distribution of field
pairs, and the previous mixture modeling may be biased because of selection
effects.

As a more conservative and much simpler model for the comoving fraction, f, we
have re-done the analysis by modeling only the radial velocity differences
between pairs.

We think the referee has misunderstood the interpretation of "f" (the comoving
probability), so we have updated much of the language to try to clarify. f is
not the probability that a given pair is a coeval, comoving pair of stars, but
rather it is just the probability that two stars are comoving in three
dimensions. Given this distinction and the assumptions specified in the text, we
think our model is specified correctly. We have added the following text to the
section on modeling (see bold text in Section 3):

"We note that $f$ is \emph{not} the fraction of pairs that are coeval and
comoving; here we only model the fraction of pairs that are consistent with
being comoving in 3D velocity space given our measurements, some of which could
be chance alignments of stars in full-space position and velocity.
Therefore, $f$ is not a measure of our contamination rate due to random
alignments of comoving stars."

We have also added a similar note to the beginning of the results section:

"We again note that $f$ is not a measure of contamination from chance
field star pairings, but rather just quantifies the fraction of pairs within our
observed sample that are consistent with having a small 3D velocity difference."

In editing the text to clarify this point, we also have softened some of our
claims based on the resulting high-probability pairs. Without also modeling the
total distribution function of the Milky Way and all selection effects, we can't
actually know the contamination fraction of unassociated stars with the same 3D
velocity at large separations. From the LAMOST data visualized in this work, and
from recent work by Andrews et al., large separation (>1 pc) comoving in 3D
pairs with the same chemical abundances do exist, and so we now only state that
further follow-up of our sample of confidently 3D comoving pairs should allow
for a refined sample that contains likely coeval, very wide separation pairs. We
have added some text to the results section to try to clarify this - see bolded
text.

We agree that there is likely significant contamination in the Oh et al. 2017
sample at large separations; this is stated in the original paper, and in this
paper text. One clarification: Oh et al. 2017 do not select pairs as being
"common proper motion," but rather construct a statistical model that accounts
for projection effects when comparing stars with the same 3D velocity that have
large (>~ 1 deg) separations.

We believe that we have shown that some fraction of the large separation pairs
are consistent with being comoving, but agree that we can't conclude whether
these systems are coeval or chance alignments (and have stated this in the
text). We feel that it is still worth discussing these systems because of their
great interest. Precisely because contamination is an issue at large
separations, by identifying pairs that appear to be comoving with low-resolution
spectroscopy, we can improve yields for follow-up with higher resolution
spectroscopy (as is planned and being pursued by other members of our group).
We feel that we have stressed this point in the discussion, but have added some
qualifying statements to the conclusions section to help clarify.
