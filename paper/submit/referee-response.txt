We thank the referee for the constructive report and suggested improvements. To
address the referee's concerns, we have redone and rewritten our population
modeling to provide a probabilistic classification of each pair as being
"comoving" or "field." Though our conclusions or results haven't changed as a
result of this change, we agree that it is more robust and more honest to
provide probabilities for each pair rather than perform a hard cut on likelihood
ratio increase. We believe that the re-analysis and re-write of our modeling
section will address many of the broader concerns the referee had with this work
and thus don't reply to every issue specifically. We've also moved away from
using the word "confirmed comoving pairs" and instead say "high-probability."
See especially sections 3 and 4 in the revised draft.

To assist the referee in interpreting the differences, we have also uploaded a
"diff"ed and rendered version of the paper that shows the changes made
(diff.pdf).

Below we address additional, specific concerns raised in the report: lines that
contain questions or comments raised by the referee begin with ">" and our
responses are listed immediately below.

We agree, and have moved it into the "Results" section - see Section 4.4

We aren't aware of a spectroscopic reduction pipeline that uses Gaussian
processes or flexible model for the spectral extraction or wavelength
calibration, so we have chosen to leave the description in this paper. We placed
it in the appendix because we agree that, while cumbersome, does describe a
novel reduction procedure. Most readers can just ignore the appendix.

Fixed.

For each star in TGAS, we compute the likelihood ratio for all nearby stars
(within 10pc). We've restructured this sentence to try to clarify.

Fixed.

Fixed. In fact, we fixed this to read "all 195,294 TGAS stars with 2MASS
photometry within 200 pc...".
